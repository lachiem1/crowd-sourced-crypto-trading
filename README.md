# crowd-sourced-crypto-trading
A collection of backend services that allow anyone to compare ridiculous crypto trading 'strategies', with the aim of seeing which silly combinations of ingested data can outperform the market in the short term.

The end goal of this project will be to expose a web page that allows anyone to choose from preset trading algorithms, or random combinations of rules to buy/sell cryptocurrency. Users can see profit/loss graphs to compare their chosen strategies, and even compete vs a randomised algorithm.

**Disclaimer:** 
- Nothing in this project constitutes financial advice
- This project is intended to be a fun way for me to build and show off a comprehensive backend application, that is over-engineered for its size/scale
- This project does not allow you to, or advise you to place trades. It is a mock, for-fun simulator
